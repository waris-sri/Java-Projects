# Description
## Game Rules
Each time you start, you'll need to enter how many digits you want your integers to have. Then the game will generate a random number from 0 to the number you chose. To win, you need to guess what the numbers are by entering your answer into the terminal. Every time you guess, the game will tell you how many numbers are in the correct position. Try to guess the number with the least number of guesses possible!

Note: The digits are free of duplicates.
